              <th>1. What’s happening in Valbona?</th>
              <td>In 2016 we discovered that 3 companies have 3 concessions to build up to 14 “small” hydropower plants
along 30km of the Valbona River. Since then, a growing number of local people, with the local NGO
TOKA ,together with Friends of Valbona, supporters, activists and artists from all over Albania, have
been fighting to stop the construction. Construction of the first small HPP started in 2014, with two
                more plants beginning construction by September 2016.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th>2. What’s wrong with Hydropower in Valbona?</th>
              <td>The hydropowers in Valbona do are “run of river” – this means that for each HPP, a section of the river is
removed, and put into a tunnel or tube. Most of the Valbona HPP tunnels are 3km long. The longest
one is 6km. With 14 hydropowers approved, and each HPP placed where the last one stops, this means
that in the HPP locations, the river will be changed and virtually dry, as up to 80% of the water will run in
underground tubes, emerging above only long enough to pass through a turbine before entering the
next tunnel.<td>
