              <th>1. What’s happening in Valbona?</th>
              <td>In 2016 we discovered that 3 companies have 3 concessions to build up to 14 “small” hydropower plants
along 30km of the Valbona River. Since then, a growing number of local people, with the local NGO
TOKA ,together with Friends of Valbona, supporters, activists and artists from all over Albania, have
been fighting to stop the construction. Construction of the first small HPP started in 2014, with two
                more plants beginning construction by September 2016.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th>2. What’s wrong with Hydropower in Valbona?</th>
              <td>The hydropowers in Valbona do are “run of river” – this means that for each HPP, a section of the river is
removed, and put into a tunnel or tube. Most of the Valbona HPP tunnels are 3km long. The longest
one is 6km. With 14 hydropowers approved, and each HPP placed where the last one stops, this means
that in the HPP locations, the river will be changed and virtually dry, as up to 80% of the water will run in
underground tubes, emerging above only long enough to pass through a turbine before entering the
next tunnel.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th>3. If there’s no river, what will we see instead? </th>
              <td>Instead of a blue river, we will have a small trickle of water left, or possibly dry river beds, filled with
small dams and reservoirs, powerhouse factories and tall metal high tension power cables. </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th>4. Where exactly is this happening? </th>
              <td>The 14 HPP are in two clusters:<br>
- 8 plants inside the valley and national park<br>
- 6 plants starting above Bajram Curri and finishing in Bujan.<br>
The Valbona Valley cluster take the water from 15km of the rivers. It will destroy 10km of the Valbona
River and will cause the total disappearing of the Cerem, Motina, Milloshi and Shpanik Rivers.<br>
The Dojan cluster will affect 15km of river and tributaries. It will create an artificial lake in Bujan,
flooding farmland and archeological sites. Together, these 6 plants may remove most of the river from
Bajram Curri, Dojan and Bujan.<br>
<span style="color:red">Occasionally the government claims that plans for some of the hydropowers have been abandoned, but
  to date there is no formal cancellation of any of the 14 plants. </span></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th>5. How are people affected if most of the rivers disappear? </th>
              <td> During Summer 2017, local communities in the villages of Valbona had no drinking and irrigation water
for three months. Their drinking water springs disappeared.<br>
During the heavy rains of Winter 2017-2018, the erosion caused by the construction and the tunnels,
caused flooding in areas it had never happened before.<br>
Local, national and international visitors will lose the attractions with most water to swim, raft or fish in,
including landmarks, such as the river by “Ura e Valbonës”, a highly popular spot for locals “dem baba
dem”.<br>
The panorama of the Valbona Valley National Park will be seriously affected by dry riverbeds, iron
towers, cement blocks and industrial buildings.<br>
With the negative impacts on tourism, the local economy in the Tropoja Region will suffer, with many
guides, waiters, artisans, taxi drivers losing their jobs, and many hotels, guest houses and small
restaurants losing their clients.<br>
With Valbona being declared a national park and praised in cultural references, such as music and
literature, we Albanians will lose a valuable national asset that belongs to all of us.</td>
